Lily Gray has worked with me as an intern this summer, and her first project was to build an online calculator to help researchers make decisions about using ANCOVA or change scores to analyze learning gains.

The calculator, [available here](https://lilygray.github.io/ancova-change-score/), is based on the 2016 article, "Accounting for the Relationship Between Initial Status and Growth in Regression Models," by Sean Kelly and Feifei Ye. A link to that article is available on the calculator page.
