Skylar White Defended AP Research Project today!

I was Skylar's mentor for conducting the experiment (design and analysis). Her project looked at the effect of [MOBA video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena) on critical thinking and reaction time. Overall she found no significant effects but learned a lot.
