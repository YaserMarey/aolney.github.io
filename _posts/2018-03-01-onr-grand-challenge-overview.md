ONR's STEM education Grand Challenge, an $8 million three-year initiative, is designed to spur innovation and creativity in the advancement of cost-effective digital tutors that tailor instruction to the individual needs and learning pace of students.

In the first phase, 4 teams worked on separate projects in different domains:

1. University of Memphis
2. Arizona State University
3. University of Massachusetts
4. Raytheon BBN Technologies

In the second phase (ONR N00014-12-C-0643,ONR N00014-16-C-3027), we are working together on a single domain, electronics.
