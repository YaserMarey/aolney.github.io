Ben Armstrong Defended AP Research Project today: "How Video Game Genre Affects Spatial Reasoning and Working Memory in Teens: A Correlational Study. "

This was my first year participating in [AP Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Capstone#AP_Research) with [White Station High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Station_High_School).

This year I primarily served in an evaluative role rather than a mentor, but hope to take on a mentor role in future years.
