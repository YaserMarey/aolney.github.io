I've moved my old Google Site to GitHub!

The new site structure is based on "tags" and "posts" which allow me to cross-categorize work but also maintain a journal-type structure based on time.

I've tried to be fairly accurate with the timing of old posts, but could be off by weeks or months in some cases (e.g. publications I defaulted to Jan 1st of the appropriate year).
