After stepping down as Director of the IIS, I decided to write a handbook!

The first draft is finished and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/memphis-iis/iis-handbook).

Using GitHub, AsciiDoc, and the template provided by *Pro Git*, the handbook can be modified and maintained like a piece of software, and similarly it has various build targets: pdf, epub, html, etc.
