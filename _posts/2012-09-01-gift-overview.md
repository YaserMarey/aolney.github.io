GIFT is an empirically-based, service-oriented framework of tools, methods and standards to make it easier to author computer-based tutoring systems (CBTS), manage instruction and assess the effect of CBTS, components and methodologies. GIFT is being developed under the Adaptive Tutoring Research Science & Technology project at the Learning in Intelligent Tutoring Environments (LITE) Laboratory, part of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory - Human Research and Engineering Directorate (ARL-HRED).

We convene annual conferences of researchers on select tutoring system topics and generate [books from the outcomes of those meetings (the "Design Recommendations" series).](https://www.gifttutoring.org/projects/gift/documents)

In addition we are building GIFT prototypes that demonstrate AutoTutor integration with virtual environments.
