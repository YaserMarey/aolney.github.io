I've been working on [several Fable examples](https://github.com/aolney?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=fable&type=&language=) to work out little ideas before putting them into the BrainTrust client.

Today I became a member of the [fable-electron team](https://github.com/orgs/fable-compiler/teams/fable-electron) on GitHub, so future ideas/samples will appear there.
