Blair Lehman graduated with a Ph.D.  in Psychology!

I had the good fortune of being a Ph.D. committee member and working with Blair on the Guru project and Boredom project where we published several papers.

Blair's first job is at [Educational Testing Service](https://sites.google.com/site/blairlehman/)
